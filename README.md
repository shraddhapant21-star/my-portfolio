About

This repository contains my personal portfolio website.
I built it to document my learning journey and to present my frontend projects and writing in one place.

What’s Inside

The portfolio includes a collection of frontend projects, links to articles I’ve written, and a simple way to get in touch.
The focus is on clarity, responsiveness, and usability rather than heavy frameworks.

Tech Used

The site is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Purpose

This project exists as a learning exercise and a public record of my work as I grow as a frontend developer.
