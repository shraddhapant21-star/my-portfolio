## My Portfolio
This repository contains my personal portfolio website.
I built it to document my learning journey and to present my frontend projects and writing in one place.

## About

The portfolio includes a collection of frontend projects, links to articles I’ve written, and a simple way to get in touch with me.
The focus is on clarity, responsiveness, and usability rather than heavy frameworks.

## What Technology I have used

The site is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Purpose

This project exists as a learning exercise and a public record of my work as I grow as a frontend developer.
